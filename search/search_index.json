Recently, I set out to build a website that leverages Markdown's ease of use, allowing me to create pages with minimal fuss. My search led me to Static Site HTML generators, which sparked a chain reaction of discoveries: GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and eventually, MkDocs and MkDocs-Material. The latter's impressive capabilities had me hooked, and I wanted to take it to the next level by integrating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to automate the deployment process.</p> <p>With this goal in mind, I embarked on a mission to create a seamless workflow, where changes to my Markdown files would trigger a build, followed by automatic deployment to a production environment. The thrill of the challenge was palpable, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.</p>"},{"location":"about/#code-annotation-examples","title":"Code Annotation Examples","text":""},{"location":"about/#codeblocks","title":"Codeblocks","text":"<p>Some <code>code</code> goes here.</p>"},{"location":"about/#plain-codeblock","title":"Plain codeblock","text":"<p>A plain codeblock:</p> <pre><code>Some code here\ndef myfunction()\n// some comment\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"about/#code-for-a-specific-language","title":"Code for a specific language","text":"<p>Some more code with the <code>py</code> at the start:</p> <pre><code>import tensorflow as tf\ndef whatever()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"about/#with-a-title","title":"With a title","text":"bubble_sort.py<pre><code>def bubble_sort(items):\n    for i in range(len(items)):\n        for j in range(len(items) -

These tiles are designed to fit together without any gaps or overlaps, but they cannot be repeated in a regular pattern.</p> <p>Here are some interesting facts about Penrose tiles:</p> <ol> <li>Non-periodic: Penrose tiles are non-periodic, meaning that they cannot be repeated in a regular pattern. This is in contrast to traditional periodic tilings, such as brick walls or hexagonal tiles, which repeat in a predictable pattern.</li> <li>Aperiodic: Penrose tiles are also aperiodic, meaning that they do not have a repeating pattern. This is what makes them so unique and interesting.</li> <li>Two types of tiles: There are two types of Penrose tiles: the \"Rhombus\" and the \"Kite\". The Rhombus tile has two acute angles and two obtuse angles, while the Kite tile has two acute angles and two right angles.</li> <li>Tiling rules: To create a Penrose tiling, you need to follow specific rules. The Rhombus tile can be placed in one of two ways, and the Kite tile can be placed in one of four ways. These rules ensure that the tiles fit together without gaps or overlaps.</li> <li>Infinity: Penrose tilings can be extended infinitely in all directions, without repeating. This means that you can create a Penrose tiling that covers an entire surface, without ever repeating a pattern.</li> <li>Artistic applications: Penrose tilings have been used in various artistic applications, such as architecture, design, and even music. They add a unique and fascinating element to any design.</li> <li>Mathematical significance: Penrose tilings have significant mathematical implications. They demonstrate the existence of non-periodic structures and have connections to other areas of mathematics, such as group theory and algebraic geometry.</li> </ol> <p>If you're interested in exploring Penrose tiles further, you can try creating your own tiling using paper or digital tools.

In the example above, the 10% tariff is an ad valorem tariff.</li> <li>Specific tariff: This is a fixed amount per unit of the imported product.

This can lead to a general increase in prices (inflation), meaning citizens have to pay more for certain products. If there are no or few domestic alternatives, this can significantly impact household budgets.</li> <li>Protection of domestic industry: One of the main reasons for introducing import tariffs is to protect domestic industries from competition from cheaper foreign products. By increasing the price of imported products, domestic products become relatively more attractive, which can lead to increased demand for these products and the preservation or creation of jobs within the country.</li> <li>Less choice: If import tariffs discourage the import of certain goods, this can lead to a smaller supply of products for consumers. Citizens may have less choice and access to specific products that are not produced domestically.</li> <li>Possible retaliatory measures: If one country imposes import tariffs, other countries may retaliate by also imposing tariffs on goods exported from the first country. This can lead to a trade war, where the prices of both import and export products rise, which is detrimental to both consumers and businesses.</li> <li>Increased government revenue: Import tariffs generate revenue for the government. This revenue can be used to fund public services or to reduce other taxes.</li> <li>Stimulation of domestic innovation: By reducing competition from foreign products, domestic companies may be encouraged to innovate and produce more efficiently to better compete, even without the protection of tariffs. However, the opposite can also happen, where protected industries become less inclined to innovate because the pressure from competition decreases.</li> <li>Effects on different income groups: The impact of import tariffs can vary across different income groups. If tariffs are levied on essential goods, this can have a greater impact on lower-income households, who spend a larger portion of their budget on these goods.</li> </ul> <p>In short, import tariffs are a complex tool with both potential benefits (such as protecting domestic industry and government revenue) and drawbacks (such as higher prices and less choice for consumers). The ultimate impact on citizens depends on the specific goods on which the tariffs are levied, the level of the tariffs, and the reaction of other countries.</p>","tags":["US","foreign trading","Netherlands"]},{"location":"blog/2025/07/19/software-architecture-the-hard-parts---neal-ford/","title":"Software Architecture, The Hard Parts - Neal Ford","text":"","tags":["Architecture","Tradeoffs","Granularity","Event-Driven","Reuse","Decoupling","Microservices","Neal Ford","Software Design"]},{"location":"blog/2025/07/19/software-architecture-the-hard-parts---neal-ford/#the-architects-dilemma-a-world-of-awful-tradeoffs","title":"The Architect's Dilemma: A World of Awful Tradeoffs","text":"<p>In his insightful talk, \"Software Architecture: The Hard Parts,\" Neal Ford delves into the core challenges that make the role of a software architect so demanding.

For centuries, this barrier seemed insurmountable, dictating the maximum velocity a ship could achieve. However, human ingenuity, driven by the thrill of competition and the desire for faster transport, led to groundbreaking innovations. The video traces the exciting rise of racing yachts and the intense evolution of the America's Cup, a crucible of design and engineering where every rule and limitation was rigorously tested and often circumvented.</p> <p>But what happens when you truly break past hull speed? The video takes us into the chaotic realm of cavitation \u2013 the formation of vapor bubbles in a liquid due to pressure changes, which can lead to significant drag and even damage.

This video delves into a crucial rewilding project focused on restoring Iceland's native birchwoods, a vital part of its ecological heritage. Once covering a significant portion of the landscape, these resilient woodlands, offering shelter, food for biodiversity, and crucial soil stabilization, have dwindled to a mere 1% of their former glory. Join us as we explore the challenges and innovative approaches to bringing these essential ecosystems back to life.</p> <p>The project, located about 120km east of Reykjavik in the southern uplands, is a collaborative effort with the Iceland Forest Service and private landowners. It addresses a critical need, as natural succession in these harsh volcanic and glacial environments could take centuries or even millennia. A significant aspect highlighted in the video is \"The Lupine Question\" \u2013 the complex role of the Nootka lupine. While this introduced species has been used for its soil-stabilizing and nitrogen-fixing properties, its potential to hinder the re-establishment of native birch is a nuanced debate. Mossy Earth navigates these ecological complexities, aiming for a balanced and sustainable restoration that fosters true biodiversity and rewilds Iceland's unique landscapes.</p> <p>This initiative isn't just about planting trees; it's about restoring a complete ecosystem, enhancing carbon sequestration, and creating windbreaks to protect the fragile soil. By supporting this project, members are directly contributing to the long-term health and biodiversity of Iceland, demonstrating that even reclaiming deserts is a task we can tackle together.</p> <p>Original video: https://youtu.be/w-pT56a5ZUc?si=n4GJ-GGumv76X6of</p>","tags":["Iceland","Desert Reclamation","Rewilding","Birchwoods","Ecosystem Restoration"]},{"location":"blog/2025/10/06/life-inside-the-line---why-saudi-arabias-glass-megacity-will-fail-an-architectural-analysis/","title":"Life Inside 'THE LINE' - Why Saudi Arabia's Glass Megacity Will Fail (An Architectural Analysis)","text":"<p>Saudi Arabia's ambitious Neom project, particularly \"The Line,\" presents a vision of a hyper-modern, linear city unlike anything ever conceived. Stretching an astounding 170 kilometers, this mirrored glass megastructure promises a revolution in urban living, aiming to eliminate cars, roads, and carbon emissions. However, a closer architectural analysis reveals that beneath its sleek, futuristic facade, \"The Line\" might be less of a utopian marvel and more of a meticulously designed trap, facing fundamental challenges that could lead to its ultimate failure.</p> <p>The video delves into three critical areas, starting with Urban Sprawl and its inverse in \"The Line.\" While traditional cities struggle with outward expansion, \"The Line's\" extreme linearity creates a different kind of constraint. The video suggests that confining millions within a narrow, vertical prism could lead to psychological challenges, limiting organic growth and the natural evolution of community spaces. The reliance on internal high-speed transit, while innovative, also raises questions about its capacity, resilience, and the sheer monotony of navigating a perpetually enclosed environment.</p> <p>Next, the analysis tackles Liveability, examining the practicalities of daily life within this futuristic marvel. Questions arise about natural light, ventilation, and the psychological impact of living in a city where the natural world is largely experienced through reflective glass or carefully curated internal spaces. The video explores whether the proposed solutions, such as vertical farming and integrated services, can truly compensate for the loss of diverse urban landscapes and spontaneous interactions found in traditional cities. The highly controlled and planned nature of \"The Line\" could stifle individuality and limit the vibrant, unpredictable elements that make cities truly dynamic and engaging.</p> <p>Finally, the video critically examines the pursuit of Perfection. \"The Line\" embodies a top-down, engineered approach to urban design, striving for an idealized state. However, the video argues that true urban success often emerges from organic development, adaptation, and the diverse needs of its inhabitants. Designing a city from scratch with such rigid parameters might overlook unforeseen human needs and environmental complexities, creating a sterile rather than sustainable future. The immense logistical, environmental, and human costs of building such a monumental structure, coupled with its inherent inflexibility, lead to the conclusion that \"The Line's\" promise of perfection might be its greatest flaw, setting it on a path toward an inevitable architectural and social struggle.</p> <p>Ultimately, while \"The Line\" is a fascinating architectural experiment, this analysis suggests that its grand vision might be fundamentally at odds with the complex, messy, and wonderfully unpredictable nature of human life and urbanism. The video encourages us to consider whether the future of cities lies in imposing rigid, perfect designs, or in fostering adaptable, human-centered environments that evolve with their communities.</p> <p>Original video: Original video: https://youtu.be/c-jtIRvmbsk?si=Rty900PMtFkRHrI3</p>","tags":["The Line","Neom","Saudi Arabia","Megacity","Urban Development"]},{"location":"blog/2025/10/30/the-real-reason-ai-is-going-back-to-the-terminal/","title":"The Real Reason AI Is Going Back to the Terminal","text":"<p>Have you noticed the sudden resurgence of Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) in the AI world?
