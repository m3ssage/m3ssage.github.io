## Is Your Well Pump Failing? Here's How to Diagnose and Fix It Yourself!

The hum of a well pump is the silent symphony of a functioning household that relies on well water. But when that hum stops, or worse, your taps run dry, panic can set in. Before you call a costly professional, consider diving into the repair yourself. MendItMark, a master of practical home repairs, has created an incredibly thorough video that empowers homeowners to diagnose, troubleshoot, and even replace their own well pump.

This comprehensive guide covers everything from initial symptoms to the final re-pressurization, making a seemingly complex task accessible. Let's break down the essential steps he covers:

### Step 1: Initial Diagnosis – Understanding the Symptoms

Before grabbing any tools, it's crucial to observe what your well pump *isn't* doing, or what it's doing incorrectly. MendItMark starts by addressing common issues:

*   **Pump not running at all:** The simplest fix could be a tripped circuit breaker.
*   **Pump running constantly:** This often points to a leak in your system or a faulty pressure switch.
*   **Pump tripping the breaker:** This suggests an electrical short or a seized motor within the pump.

He also emphasizes checking the **pressure tank's air pressure**, a frequently overlooked component that can cause various symptoms if improperly set.

### Step 2: Pinpointing the Problem – Testing Key Components

Once you've identified the symptom, the next step is to methodically test the critical parts of your system:

*   **The Pressure Switch:** This device is the brain of your well system, telling the pump when to turn on and off based on water pressure. MendItMark demonstrates how to safely test it using a multimeter to check for proper electrical contact.
*   **The Well Pump Motor:** If the pressure switch is working, the issue might be with the pump itself. The video shows how to test the pump motor directly at the well head for continuity in its windings, which helps determine if the motor is seized or has an open circuit.

### Step 3: Removing the Old Pump (If Necessary)

If your testing confirms the pump itself is faulty, then removal is the next big step. This process requires careful attention to detail and safety:

1.  **Safety First:** Always disconnect power to the pump at the breaker and shut off the main water supply to your house.
2.  **Drain the System:** Open a faucet to relieve pressure and drain water from your lines.
3.  **Disconnection:** Carefully remove the well cap, and disconnect all plumbing and electrical connections leading to the pump.
4.  **The Pull:** The video provides crucial tips for carefully pulling the old pump, along with its attached pipe and wires, from the well. This can be a multi-person job depending on the depth.

### Step 4: Installing the New Submersible Pump

Installing a new pump is essentially the reverse of removal, but with vital steps to ensure proper function and longevity:

*   **Preparation:** Attach the safety rope (which is paramount – never rely solely on the pipe!), torque arrestors (to prevent pump rotation), and the new water pipe to the pump.
*   **Electrical Connections:** Make sure all electrical splices are made correctly and are fully waterproofed, as they will be submerged.
*   **Lowering:** Carefully lower the new pump into the well, ensuring the safety rope is securely fastened at the top.
*   **Reconnection:** Reconnect all water lines and electrical conduit at the well head, ensuring tight, leak-free connections.

### Step 5: System Re-pressurization and Final Checks

The final leg of the journey involves bringing your water system back to life:

*   **Re-pressurize:** Slowly reintroduce water into the system, listening for leaks and allowing the pump to build pressure.
*   **Verify Function:** Confirm that the new pump turns on, builds pressure effectively, and that your pressure switch cycles properly, maintaining consistent water pressure throughout your home.

MendItMark's video is a true DIY lifeline for anyone facing well pump issues. His clear, step-by-step instructions, combined with visual demonstrations and safety warnings, make what seems like an intimidating repair a genuinely achievable project for the home mechanic.
