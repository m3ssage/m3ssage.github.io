Embark on a fascinating journey to Iceland, where Mossy Earth is tackling the monumental task of reclaiming the island's vast deserts. This video delves into a crucial rewilding project focused on restoring Iceland's native birchwoods, a vital part of its ecological heritage. Once covering a significant portion of the landscape, these resilient woodlands, offering shelter, food for biodiversity, and crucial soil stabilization, have dwindled to a mere 1% of their former glory. Join us as we explore the challenges and innovative approaches to bringing these essential ecosystems back to life.

The project, located about 120km east of Reykjavik in the southern uplands, is a collaborative effort with the Iceland Forest Service and private landowners. It addresses a critical need, as natural succession in these harsh volcanic and glacial environments could take centuries or even millennia. A significant aspect highlighted in the video is "The Lupine Question" â€“ the complex role of the Nootka lupine. While this introduced species has been used for its soil-stabilizing and nitrogen-fixing properties, its potential to hinder the re-establishment of native birch is a nuanced debate. Mossy Earth navigates these ecological complexities, aiming for a balanced and sustainable restoration that fosters true biodiversity and rewilds Iceland's unique landscapes.

This initiative isn't just about planting trees; it's about restoring a complete ecosystem, enhancing carbon sequestration, and creating windbreaks to protect the fragile soil. By supporting this project, members are directly contributing to the long-term health and biodiversity of Iceland, demonstrating that even reclaiming deserts is a task we can tackle together.
