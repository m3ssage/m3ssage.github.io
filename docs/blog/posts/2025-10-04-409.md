In a recent discussion, esteemed former Director-General at Foreign Affairs and top diplomat, Mark Geleyn, offered a compelling perspective on the ongoing conflict in Gaza. His analysis challenges widespread narratives, emphatically stating that Israel's actions are not an act of genocide, but rather that the true genocidal intent was displayed by Hamas during its October 7th attacks. This insightful conversation aims to shed light on the complexities of the situation, drawing on Geleyn's extensive experience in international relations.

Geleyn, known for his deep understanding of global affairs, meticulously examines the terminology and implications surrounding the accusations of genocide. He argues that the definition of genocide, as per international law, must be carefully applied, and that the nature of Israel's response fundamentally differs from the premeditated and systematic extermination implied by the term. Instead, he posits that the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7th, which involved the deliberate targeting and mass killing of civilians, align more closely with genocidal intent. His viewpoint urges a critical re-evaluation of the discourse surrounding the conflict, emphasizing the importance of accurate legal and historical framing. The expert's insights are particularly valuable for understanding the diplomatic nuances and the challenging legal landscape of the Middle East.
