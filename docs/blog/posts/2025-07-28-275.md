Ever wondered why your favorite tech platforms, once sleek and user-friendly, now feel bogged down with an endless stream of ads and questionable content? You're not alone! This VPRO Tegenlicht documentary dives deep into a phenomenon aptly termed "Enshittification" by American activist and writer Cory Doctorow. It explains how platforms like Google, Instagram, and YouTube are deliberately degrading their services, filling search results with ads and scams, and prioritizing revenue over user experience.

Doctorow's insightful analysis dissects the troubling trend of major tech companies intentionally making their products worse, seemingly without consequence. The classic economic principle that a poor product would naturally make way for better alternatives simply doesn't hold true in today's digital economy. These powerful companies have established such dominance that users often feel trapped, continuing to use subpar services due to a lack of viable competition. This exploration into "Enshittification" reveals the underlying mechanisms that allow these digital giants to prioritize profit over public good, leading to daily frustrations and genuine concerns about the future of the internet itself.
