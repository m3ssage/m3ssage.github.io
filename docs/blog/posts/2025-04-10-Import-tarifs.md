# Import tariffs

An import tariff is a tax levied on goods entering a country. It's essentially an additional cost added to the price of the imported product.

## How does an import tariff work?

Imagine a Dutch company imports shoes from China. The Dutch government might decide to impose an import tariff of, for example, 10% on shoes. This means that for every shoe the Dutch company imports, they have to pay an extra 10% of the shoe's value to the Dutch government.

There are different ways an import tariff can be levied:

- Ad valorem tariff: This is the most common type of tariff and is expressed as a percentage of the customs value of the goods. In the example above, the 10% tariff is an ad valorem tariff.
- Specific tariff: This is a fixed amount per unit of the imported product. For example, â‚¬2 per imported shoe.
- Combined tariff: This is a combination of an ad valorem tariff and a specific tariff.

The importer pays the import tariff at customs when the goods enter the country. These costs are then often passed on to the consumer in the price of the product they buy.

## What is the consequence for the citizens?

The introduction of an import tariff can have several consequences for the citizens of a country:

- Higher prices: The most direct consequence is that the price of imported goods increases. This can lead to a general increase in prices (inflation), meaning citizens have to pay more for certain products. If there are no or few domestic alternatives, this can significantly impact household budgets.
- Protection of domestic industry: One of the main reasons for introducing import tariffs is to protect domestic industries from competition from cheaper foreign products. By increasing the price of imported products, domestic products become relatively more attractive, which can lead to increased demand for these products and the preservation or creation of jobs within the country.
- Less choice: If import tariffs discourage the import of certain goods, this can lead to a smaller supply of products for consumers. Citizens may have less choice and access to specific products that are not produced domestically.
- Possible retaliatory measures: If one country imposes import tariffs, other countries may retaliate by also imposing tariffs on goods exported from the first country. This can lead to a trade war, where the prices of both import and export products rise, which is detrimental to both consumers and businesses.
- Increased government revenue: Import tariffs generate revenue for the government. This revenue can be used to fund public services or to reduce other taxes.
- Stimulation of domestic innovation: By reducing competition from foreign products, domestic companies may be encouraged to innovate and produce more efficiently to better compete, even without the protection of tariffs. However, the opposite can also happen, where protected industries become less inclined to innovate because the pressure from competition decreases.
- Effects on different income groups: The impact of import tariffs can vary across different income groups. If tariffs are levied on essential goods, this can have a greater impact on lower-income households, who spend a larger portion of their budget on these goods.

In short, import tariffs are a complex tool with both potential benefits (such as protecting domestic industry and government revenue) and drawbacks (such as higher prices and less choice for consumers). The ultimate impact on citizens depends on the specific goods on which the tariffs are levied, the level of the tariffs, and the reaction of other countries.
