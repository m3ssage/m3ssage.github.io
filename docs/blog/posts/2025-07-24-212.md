I need to create a blog post summarizing the YouTube video from "De Nieuwe Wereld" featuring Pim van Rijswijk.

Here's my plan:
1.  **Analyze Video Information:**
    *   **Title:** "\"Voor projecten die de elite belangrijk vindt, is er geld genoeg\" | #2011 Pim van Rijswijk" which translates to "'For projects the elite finds important, there is plenty of money' | #2011 Pim van Rijswijk".
    *   **Description & Timestamps:** The video is a conversation between Marlies Dekkers and Pim van Rijswijk. The key topics are:
        *   A large number of Dutch citizens want to emigrate.
        *   A sarcastic or critical take on the government's performance.
        *   The housing market and the "Box 3" wealth tax.
        *   A perceived movement towards expropriation ("onteigening").
        *   The rise of a "control society."
        *   A philosophical/spiritual dimension: "It's all about the soul."
        *   A practical solution for entrepreneurs: putting assets into a private company (BV).
    *   **Guest:** Pim van Rijswijk, who runs an organization helping people with their "Plan B" and has a podcast called "De Springplank voor Vertrek" (The Springboard for Departure). This context is crucial – he advises people on financial structures and potentially on emigrating.

2.  **Structure the Blog Post:**
    *   **Frontmatter:**
        *   `title`: "Voor projecten die de elite belangrijk vindt, is er geld genoeg | Pim van Rijswijk" (using a comma, as requested).
        *   `date`: Current timestamp.
        *   `author`: "eelco".
        *   `categories`: "Society", "Politics", "Economics", "Netherlands".
        *   `tags`: "Pim van Rijswijk", "De Nieuwe Wereld", "Netherlands", "Government Policy", "Wealth Tax", "Box 3", "Control Society", "Emigration".
    *   **Hook/Opening:** Start with the provocative idea mentioned in the timestamps: "Millions of Dutch people want to leave." This immediately grabs attention and sets a critical tone. Frame it as a symptom of a deeper discontent among citizens and entrepreneurs.
    *   **Introduce the Core Conflict:** Present Pim van Rijswijk's main argument. On one hand, citizens and entrepreneurs feel squeezed by rising taxes (like the Box 3 saga), a difficult housing market, and an encroaching control society. On the other hand, as the title suggests, there seems to be unlimited funding for large-scale government and elite-driven projects (like climate and nitrogen policies). This creates a sense of unfairness and alienation.
    *   **The Squeeze on the Middle Class:** Elaborate on the key pain points for the (upper) middle class and entrepreneurs:
        *   **Box 3 Tax:** Explain this isn't just a tax issue, but is perceived as a form of "onteigening" (expropriation), where the government claims a significant portion of saved and invested capital, regardless of actual returns.
        *   **Control Society:** Touch upon the idea that regulations and digital systems (like the future CBDC) are creating a society with less freedom and more top-down control.
    *   **The "Plan B":** Explain what Pim van Rijswijk's solution is. For many, this is a "Plan B," which involves either restructuring assets or leaving the country altogether.
        *   **Practical Advice:** Mention his concrete tip: move your assets into a private company (BV) to protect them from policies like the Box 3 tax. This shows he's offering practical escape routes.
        *   **Emigration:** Frame the desire to leave not as a rejection of the Netherlands itself, but of its current political and economic climate.
    *   **The Philosophical Layer:** Briefly touch upon the "it's all about the soul" comment. This suggests the struggle isn't just financial, but also about a loss of meaning, autonomy, and trust in the system. It's about people wanting to live a life aligned with their own values, which they feel is becoming impossible.
    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize the conversation's core message. A growing group of productive citizens feels alienated by a government that seems to prioritize elite projects over their well-being and prosperity. The talk serves as both a diagnosis of this discontent and a practical guide for those seeking a way out.
    *   **Reference:** Add the link to the original YouTube video at the end.

3.  **Formatting:**
    *   Standard Markdown with frontmatter.
    *   Include `<!-- more -->` after the first paragraph.
    *   Use headings, bolding, and maybe a blockquote for the main title quote to make the post engaging.
    *   The tone will be slightly critical and analytical, reflecting the tone of the video itself.

This structured approach allows me to capture the essence of the hour-long conversation effectively, using the provided metadata to guide the narrative of the blog post.---

A specter is haunting the Netherlands, and it's the growing desire of its own citizens to leave. In a candid conversation with Marlies Dekkers on "De Nieuwe Wereld," wealth advisor Pim van Rijswijk lays bare the deep-seated frustration felt by many Dutch entrepreneurs and citizens. They feel squeezed by a system that seems to have unlimited funds for elite projects while placing an ever-heavier burden on its most productive people.

### The Great Squeeze: Taxes, Control, and Discontent

Van Rijswijk, whose work involves creating "Plan B" scenarios for clients, argues that a significant portion of the Dutch population no longer feels at home in their own country. The reasons are multifaceted but boil down to a core conflict: a feeling of being milked for a system they no longer believe in.

At the heart of the issue are several key pressure points:

1.  **The Box 3 Wealth Tax:** What was meant to be a tax on investment returns has, in the eyes of many, morphed into a form of slow expropriation ("onteigening"). Citizens are taxed on fictitious, government-mandated returns on their savings and assets, even when they make a loss. This is seen not just as unfair, but as a fundamental breach of property rights.
2.  **The Housing Crisis:** The dream of owning a home is out of reach for many, while those who have saved and invested find their capital being taxed away, making it even harder to build wealth or help their children.
3.  **The Rise of a Control Society:** From increasing regulations to the looming prospect of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), there's a palpable fear of losing personal autonomy and financial freedom. People feel the walls closing in.

### "For Elite Projects, There is Plenty of Money"

The frustration is compounded by a bitter observation, captured perfectly in the video's title. While the average citizen is asked to tighten their belt, there appears to be an endless supply of money for large-scale, top-down projects—be it related to climate, nitrogen, or international aid.

This creates a disconnect. The government's priorities seem radically different from those of the people it's supposed to serve. The result is a profound loss of trust and a growing sense that the social contract has been broken.

### The Escape Route: Plan B

For a growing number, the answer is a "Plan B." For some, this means restructuring their financial lives to protect their assets from the government's reach. Van Rijswijk gives a very concrete tip: move your assets into a private company (a "BV"). This simple act can shield your capital from the punishing Box 3 tax and restore a measure of financial sovereignty.

For others, Plan B is more drastic: emigration. They are looking for a new home in countries where their hard work is valued, and the government's reach is more limited. This isn't about abandoning the Netherlands, but about escaping a political and economic climate they find increasingly hostile.

Ultimately, Van Rijswijk's message is a warning. The discontent is no longer a fringe phenomenon. It's a mainstream movement of people who are not just complaining, but are actively taking steps to secure their own future, with or without the Netherlands.
