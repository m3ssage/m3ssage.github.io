## Building a Markdown-Powered Website with MkDocs

As a Markdown enthusiast, I've grown accustomed to creating content using this versatile format. Recently, I set out to build a website that leverages Markdown's ease of use, allowing me to create pages with minimal fuss. My search led me to Static Site HTML generators, which sparked a chain reaction of discoveries: GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and eventually, MkDocs and MkDocs-Material. The latter's impressive capabilities had me hooked, and I wanted to take it to the next level by integrating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to automate the deployment process.

With this goal in mind, I embarked on a mission to create a seamless workflow, where changes to my Markdown files would trigger a build, followed by automatic deployment to a production environment. The thrill of the challenge was palpable, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.
